# Wrangling Genomics

Lesson for quality control and wrangling genomics data. This repository is maintained by [Josh Herr](https://github.com/jrherr), [Ming Tang](https://github.com/crazyhottommy), and [Fotis Psomopoulos](https://github.com/fpsom).

Amazon public AMI for this tutorial is "dataCgen-qc". 

## Background

Wrangling genomics trains novice learners on a variant calling workflow. Participants will learn how to evaluate sequence quality and what to do if it is not good. We will then cover aligning reads to a genome, and calling variants, as well as discussing different file formats. Results will be visualized. Finally, we will cover how to automate the process by building a shell script.

This lesson is part of the [Data Carpentry](http://www.datacarpentry.org/) [Genomics Workshop](http://www.datacarpentry.org/genomics-workshop/).
