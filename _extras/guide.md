# Instructor Notes for Wrangling Genomics

What to do during long command waits:

### File Downloads
The fastq files take about 15 minutes to download. This would be a good time to discuss the overall workflow of this lesson as illustrated by the graphic integrated on the page. It is recommended to start this lesson with the commmands to make and move to the /data/untrimmed-fastq directory and begin the download, and while files download, cover the "Bioinformatics Workflows" and "Starting with Data" texts. Beware that the last fastq file in the list takes the longest to download (~6-8 mins).

### Running FastQC
The FastQC analysis on all raw reads takes about 10 minutes to run. It is a good idea to have learners start this command and cover the FastQC background material and images while FastQC runs.
